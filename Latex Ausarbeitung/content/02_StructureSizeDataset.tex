The data used in the remainder of this paper comes from four individual datasets collected at different universities (Zurich, Budapest, Long Beach, Cleveland). The distribution of the target variable can be seen in \cref{table:datasets}

For the purposes of this paper, the four datasets are considered as one coherent dataset consisting of 77 attributes (33 numeric 42 categorical 1 constant) and a total of 899 measurements.  
The attributes can be divided into the following categories. 
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Patient data
        \item Electrocardiogram
        \item Cardiac fluoroscopy
        \item Coronary angiograms
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
The category of \textit{patient data} includes characteristics such as \textit{age}, \textit{sex} or type of chest pain (\textit{cp}), whereas the category \textit{electrocardiogram} includes various electrocardiographic information obtained during a \textit{exercise Electrocardiogram} like the peak blood pressure (\textit{tpeakbps}). \textit{Cardiac fluoroscopy} contains all measurements obtained from a \textit{Cardiac fluoroscopy} a medical measure that allows to see the flow of blood through vessels to evaluate the presence of blockages. An example for an attribute from this category is \textit{CA} which denotes the number of found vessels. The last category is \textit{Coronary angiograms}, which contains the results of the examination of the same name. The main attribute of interest of this category is \textit{num} because it is the target variable that denotes whether a patient has a heart disease or not. In the raw data, patients without a heart disease are shown with a value of 0 for \textit{num}, while patients with heart disease are shown with a value > 1. 
An overview of all remaining attributes which were not named here is provided in our code documentation as well as the UCI Machine Learning Repository\citep{janosi1988}. In general, it is assumed that the collected attributes are of high quality, as they are the result of standardized medical measurement procedures, apart from the individual characteristics described by the patient, such as the location or type of pain. For this reason, it is assumed that a combination of the individual data sets is theoretically possible, this is also true because the measurements are not sorted in a certain way, neither in the individual data sets nor in the combined data set. Although the date for the \textit{Electrocardiogram} as well as the \textit{Coronary angiograms} are stored in the dataset, these do not allow for further interpretation, as the period covered (7 years) is too short to identify general medical developments. Furthermore, the data are unevenly distributed over the period. 

Finally, the distribution of the different variables in the combined data set was analysed. The target variable was found to be reasonably symmetrically distributed with 495 positive and 404 negative measurements, implying a disease prevalence of about 55.1\%. Non-representative distributions were also found, e.g. \textit{sex} is non-representatively distributed with 78 \% males to 22 \%. The same applies to age, which is distributed similarly to a normal distribution in the range 28 to 77.  

Lastly, verifying data quality also acts as an important part of Data Understanding. Therefore, we checked the dataset for missing values, denoted by $-9$. It was found that $30,8\%$ of all fields are lacking measurements. This is attributed to the fact that not all universities have carried out all measurements. For example the Cleveland subset lacks the location of chest pain. Some individual attributes in particular have many missing values like history of diabetes (\textit{dm}) with roughly 90\% missing values. Whereby only positive cases may have been entered here, since 95\% of all filled cells show a diabetes disease which again is not representative.
