  abstract = {In the current era, Heart Failure (HF) is one of the common diseases that can lead to dangerous situation. Every year almost 26 million of patients are affecting with this kind of disease. From the heart consultant and surgeon’s point of view, it is complex to predict the heart failure on right time. Fortunately, classification and predicting models are there, which can aid the medical field and can illustrates how to use the medical data in an efficient way. This paper aims to improve the HF prediction accuracy using UCI heart disease dataset. For this, multiple machine learning approaches used to understand the data and predict the HF chances in a medical database. Furthermore, the results and comparative study showed that, the current work improved the previous accuracy score in predicting heart disease. The integration of the machine learning model presented in this study with medical information systems would be useful to predict the HF or any other disease using the live data collected from patients.},

  abstract = {Objective: Physicians classify patients into those with or without a specific disease. Furthermore, there is often interest in classifying patients according to disease etiology or subtype. Classification trees are frequently used to classify patients according to the presence or absence of a disease. However, classification trees can suffer from limited accuracy. In the data-mining and machine-learning literature, alternate classification schemes have been developed. These include bootstrap aggregation (bagging), boosting, random forests, and support vector machines. Study Design and Setting: We compared the performance of these classification methods with that of conventional classification trees to classify patients with heart failure (HF) according to the following subtypes: HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction. We also compared the ability of these methods to predict the probability of the presence of HFPEF with that of conventional logistic regression. Results: We found that modern, flexible tree-based methods from the data-mining literature offer substantial improvement in prediction and classification of HF subtype compared with conventional classification and regression trees. However, conventional logistic regression had superior performance for predicting the probability of the presence of HFPEF compared with the methods proposed in the data-mining literature. Conclusion: The use of tree-based methods offers superior performance over conventional classification and regression trees for predicting and classifying HF subtypes in a population-based sample of patients from Ontario, Canada. However, these methods do not offer substantial improvements over logistic regression for predicting the presence of HFPEF.},

  abstract = {Data mining techniques have been widely used to mine knowledgeable information from medical data bases. In data mining classification is a supervised learning that can be used to design models describing important data classes, where class attribute is involved in the construction of the classifier. Nearest neighbor (KNN) is very simple, most popular, highly efficient and effective algorithm for pattern recognition.KNN is a straight forward classifier, where samples are classified based on the class of their nearest neighbor. Medical data bases are high volume in nature. If the data set contains redundant and irrelevant attributes, classification may produce less accurate result. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in INDIA. In Andhra Pradesh heart disease was the leading cause of mortality accounting for 32\%of all deaths, a rate as high as Canada (35\%) and USA.Hence there is a need to define a decision support system that helps clinicians decide to take precautionary steps. In this paper we propose a new algorithm which combines KNN with genetic algorithm for effective classification. Genetic algorithms perform global search in complex large and multimodal landscapes and provide optimal solution. Experimental results shows that our algorithm enhance the accuracy in diagnosis of heart disease.},

This raw dataset consist of redundant and inconsistent data thereby increasing the search space and storage of the data. To achieve the classification accuracy we need to remove the redundant and the irrelevant data present. The dimensionality reduction technique is used to compress the high dimensional data to lower dimensional data with some constraints. A framework is integrated for the easy prediction of the heart disease. The framework is created by using the principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the features and mathematical model is computed to select the relevant features using the relevant constraint. This proposed work helps in improving the efficiency, accuracy and speed of the process .This can be applied in the applications such as information retrieval, image processing and pattern matching.},

Discovery of hidden patterns and relationships often goes unexploited. Advanced data mining techniques can help remedy this situation. This research has developed a prototype Intelligent Heart Disease Prediction System (IHDPS) using data mining techniques, namely, Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes and Neural Network. Results show that each technique has its unique strength in realizing the objectives of the defined mining goals. IHDPS can answer complex “what if” queries which traditional decision support systems cannot. Using medical profiles such as age, sex, blood pressure and blood sugar it can predict the likelihood of patients getting a heart disease. It enables significant knowledge, e.g. patterns, relationships between medical factors related to heart disease, to be established. IHDPS is Web-based, user-friendly, scalable, reliable and expandable. It is implemented on the .NET platform.},
