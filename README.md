# Classifying heart disease data
This repository analyses the UCI heart disease dataset. The dataset was downloaded from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease and placed in the folder `Data`.
A description of the different features can be found in `DatamininFeatures`.

The training of the models takes place in the notebook `notebook.ipynb`. The results of this notebook are stored in the `outputs` folder.
The analysis of the results takes place in the `analyse outputs.ipynb` notebook. A more general analysis of the dataset can be found in `analysis.ipynb`. The images of this notebook are stored in the `pictures` folder, while the pandas profiling reports are stored at the root level of the repository. The last notebook `viewer.ipynb` can be used to view the status of the `notebook.ipynb` during cross validation. 

The requirements for running the notebook are stored in two files, once in a `requirements.txt` for pip and once more in `environment.yml` for conda.

This repository also contains a proposal, a report and a presentation for the University of Mannheim.
